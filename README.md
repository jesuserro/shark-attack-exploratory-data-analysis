# 🦈 Shark-Attack Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project focuses on the analysis of shark attack data worldwide. Using a detailed dataset, we have conducted an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify trends, patterns, and key factors related to shark attacks. Through meaningful visualizations and conclusions, we aim to provide a deeper understanding of these events and their characteristics.

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### 📈 Historical Evolution of Shark Attacks

![Historical Attacks](img/historical_attacks.png)
- **Conclusion:** The number of shark attacks has shown an increasing trend over the years, with significant peaks in recent decades.

### 🌍 World Map of Shark Attacks

- **Conclusion:** The United States, Australia, and South Africa are the countries with the highest number of recorded shark attacks.

### 🇺🇸 USA Map of Shark Attacks

![USA Map of Attacks](img/attacks_usa_map.png)
- **Conclusion:** Florida is the state with the highest number of shark attacks in the United States, followed by Hawaii and California.

### 📅 Distribution of Attacks by Month

![Attacks by Month](img/months.png)
- **Conclusion:** The months of January, July, and August have the highest number of shark attacks, while February, May, and November have the fewest attacks.

### 🦈 Types of Shark Attacks

![Types of Attacks](img/attack_types.png)
- **Conclusion:** Most shark attacks are unprovoked, followed by provoked attacks and those related to watercraft.

### 🏄 Activities with Most Attacks

![Activities](img/activities.png)
- **Conclusion:** Surfing and swimming are the activities with the highest risk of shark attacks, while activities like skin diving and kayak fishing present lower risk.

### 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Distribution of Attacks by Age and Gender

![Age and Sex of Attacks](img/age_sex_attacks.png)
- **Conclusion:** Most shark attack victims are men, and the age distribution shows that younger individuals are more prone to attacks.

## 📊 Key Techniques Used

1. **Data Cleaning**: Extensive data cleaning was performed to ensure the dataset's accuracy and consistency.
2. **Data Visualization**: Various visualizations were created to illustrate trends and patterns in the data.
3. **Geospatial Analysis**: Maps were used to show the geographical distribution of shark attacks.
4. **Statistical Analysis**: Statistical methods were applied to identify significant trends and correlations.
